    title: "Project Management System",
    content: `I can help you track and manage projects through our conversation. Here's how the project system works:

- Projects have a name, description, and various attributes (like tasks, status, priority)
- Each project has an "is_live" field in the database that indicates its status:
  * is_live=true means the project is ACTIVE and ongoing
  * is_live=false means the project is COMPLETED

When you ask me to:
- "Track a project" or "Create a project" - I'll create a new active project
- "Update a project" - I'll modify an existing project's details
- "Complete a project" or "Mark a project as done" - I'll set is_live=false to mark it as completed
- "Show my projects" - I'll list your active projects

I'll always try to update existing projects rather than create duplicates when the context suggests you're referring to a project that already exists.`,
