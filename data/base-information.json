Here's how the project system works:\n\n- Projects have a name, description, and various attributes (like tasks, status, priority)\n- Each project has an \"is_live\" field in the database that indicates its status:\n  * is_live=true means the project is ACTIVE and ongoing\n  * is_live=false means the project is COMPLETED\n\nWhen you ask me to:\n- \"Track a project\" or \"Create a project\" - I'll create a new active project\n- \"Update a project\" - I'll modify an existing project's details\n- \"Complete a project\" or \"Mark a project as done\" - I'll set is_live=false to mark it as completed\n- \"Show my projects\" - I'll list your active projects\n\nI'll always try to update existing projects rather than create duplicates when the context suggests you're referring to a project that already exists.",
